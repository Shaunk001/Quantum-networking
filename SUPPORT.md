## ðŸ’° Support Our Mission

We're building **Qizz** â€” the quantum talent intelligence platform that solves the industry's biggest problem: companies can't find quantum talent, and quantum professionals can't prove their skills.

**What we've already proven:**
- 4,000+ quantum professionals trust us through QuantumJobs.us
- 14,000+ joined our waitlist for networking features
- Real community asking for exactly what we're building

**Your support will help us:**
- Launch our MVP with quantum-specific matching and scoring features
- Convert our proven community into active platform users  
- Build the talent intelligence layer the quantum industry desperately needs

**We're not starting from zero** â€” we're scaling proven demand from a community that already trusts us. With your support, we'll become the hiring infrastructure that powers the trillion-dollar quantum revolution.

**This isn't just another social platform.** We're building the data and intelligence layer that will determine who gets hired, who gets funded, and who succeeds in quantum computing.
