## 🚩 The Problem

A year ago, I was debugging code at 2 AM when I stumbled across a quantum computing article. As an engineer, quantum wasn't just another technology - it was a complete reimagining of computation.

But what followed was frustrating:
- I tried joining quantum groups → Got banned on Reddit for asking questions
- I looked for learning → Everything was expensive  
- I searched for jobs → Found nothing useful in generic job boards
- I wanted to connect → LinkedIn showed marketers with "quantum" in their bios

I wasn't just struggling to learn quantum computing. I was struggling to find the quantum community that should exist — but didn't.

The quantum community is struggling with real problems:
- "How do I transition from electrical engineering to quantum hardware?" - Career transitioners can't find guidance
- "Where can I ask quantum questions without getting suspended?" - No safe space for quantum learning
- "LinkedIn shows people with 'quantum' tags who don't actually work in the field." - No way to verify real quantum expertise
- "I need someone who understands quantum error correction for my project." - Researchers can't find complementary expertise

**The brutal reality:** 87% of quantum job postings stay unfilled for 6+ months. The $1.3B industry growing to $5.3B by 2029 has broken talent infrastructure.
